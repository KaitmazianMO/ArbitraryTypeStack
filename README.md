# ArbitraryTypeStack

  ## How to use it

  ### Set type of stack first!

    To set the type of stack write this line:

    '''#define stack_t ** type (bold) **
    
    Example of setting int type:
    '''#define stack_t int

  ### Iclude the library after you set the type of stack

    To include the library you sould use this strange command:

    '''#include "stack.h"
