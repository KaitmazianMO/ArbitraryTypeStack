# ArbitraryTypeStack
  Hi :)
  ## How to use it

  ### Set type of stack first!

   To set the type of stack write this line:

   '''#define stack_t **type (bold)**
    
   **type (bold)**
    
   Example of setting int type:
   '''#define stack_t int

  ### Iclude the library after you set the type of stack

   To include the library you sould use this strange command:

   '''#include "stack.h"
