# ArbitraryTypeStack
  Hi :)
  ## How to use it

  ### Set type of stack first!

   To set the type of stack write this line:

   #define stack_t **type**
    
   Example of setting int type:
   ```#define stack_t int```

  ### Iclude the library after you set the type of stack

   To include the library you sould use this strange command:

   ```#include "stack.h"```
   
   Now you have 2 lines:
   ```
      #define stack_t int
      #include "stack.h"
   ```
      
   That means you can use new type: **stack_int**
